# The Phantom of the North Atlantic

Where the cold waters of Nova Scotia meet the relentless maritime winds, a legend older than memory itself haunts the sailors' tales.

## The Mary Celeste's Dark Cousin

Unlike the famous Mary Celeste, this spectral ship has no historical recordâ€”only whispers, passed down through generations of fishermen and maritime workers.

### Characteristics of the Apparition

- Appears only during the most violent storms
- Completely translucent, yet impossibly detailed
- Crew members seem frozen in moments of terror
- No response to radio or maritime signals

## Documented Encounters

Sailors describe a three-masted schooner, its sails tattered, hull covered in an unnatural frost. Those who claim to have seen it speak of a bone-chilling cold that penetrates beyond physical sensation.

### Survivor Testimonies

"It wasn't just a ship," says retired fisherman Robert MacLeod. "It was a window into something... else. Something waiting."

**Some vessels are not meant to be found.**
