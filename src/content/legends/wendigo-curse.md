# Hunger of the Frozen North

In the depths of the Canadian wilderness, an ancient terror lurks beyond human comprehension. The Wendigoâ€”a spirit of insatiable hunger and unending winter.

## Origins of the Curse

Long before European settlers, indigenous tribes spoke of a transformation so horrific it defied natural law. A human consumed by extreme hunger during harsh winters could become something... else.

### The Transformation

The process is gradual. First, the hunger. Then, an unnatural thinness. Skin becomes pale, almost translucent. Eyes sink deep into hollow sockets. But the most terrifying change is internal.

## Symptoms of the Wendigo

- Uncontrollable cannibalistic urges
- Supernatural strength
- Ability to mimic human voices
- Extreme resistance to cold
- Perpetual state of starvation

### Survival Stories

Survivors describe a creature tall as the pines, with antler-like protrusions and a skeletal frame. Its cry is said to freeze the blood and drive men to madness.

**Warning: Some legends are more than just stories.**
