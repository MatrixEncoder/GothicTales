# Cry of the Departed

In the misty hills of Ireland, where ancient stones whisper forgotten stories, the Banshee remains a harbinger of death that chills the soul to its core.

## The Wailing Woman

More than a mere ghost, the Banshee is a supernatural being deeply woven into Irish folklore. Her appearance is a promise—a promise of imminent death.

### Manifestations

The Banshee appears in three primary forms:
- A young, beautiful woman with flowing white hair
- A haggard, old woman with razor-sharp features
- A spectral wash woman, cleaning blood-stained clothes

## The Unmistakable Cry

Her keening—a bone-chilling wail that pierces the night—is said to be heard before a family member's death. Those who hear it rarely survive the week.

### Historical Accounts

Documented encounters span centuries. Noble families like the O'Neills and the O'Briens have generations of Banshee lore, each story more terrifying than the last.

**Some sounds are worse than silence.**
