  A figure too tall, too thin to be human. No face, just blank whiteness where features should be. The Slender Man moves between shadows, his elongated limbs bending in impossible angles.

  Those who see him are marked. Children vanish. Forests become hunting grounds. And the Slender Man watches, always watching.
