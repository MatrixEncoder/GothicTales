# Scalpel and Shadow

In the sterile world of medical precision, a monster lurks. Not just a killer, but an artist of human anatomyâ€”with victims as his canvas.

## Clinical Profile

- Background: Suspected medical professional
- Estimated IQ: 145-160
- Operational Area: Major metropolitan hospitals

### Modus Operandi

Each victim becomes a grotesque medical experiment. Surgical cuts. Precise incisions. Bodies found with impossible anatomical modifications.

## Documented Incidents

- Memorial Hospital Incident (June 15, 2023)
- St. Michael's Medical Center (September 22, 2023)
- Central City General (December 8, 2023)

### Forensic Analysis

No conventional evidence. No blood. No trace. Just perfectly executed surgical alterations that defy medical understanding.

**Some doctors play God in the darkest ways possible.**
