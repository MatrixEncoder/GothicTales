# Echoes of Madness: The Abandoned Asylum

The Ravenwood Psychiatric Hospital stood as a decaying monument to human suffering. Abandoned since 1987, its crumbling walls whispered secrets of forgotten patients and unspeakable experiments.

## The First Night

When I first stepped into the asylum's main corridor, the air felt thick with despair. Peeling wallpaper revealed glimpses of old patient records, their names scratched out as if someone—or something—wanted to erase their existence.

### Unexplained Phenomena

My thermal camera caught strange heat signatures in the east wing. Rooms that should have been empty flickered with cold spots and inexplicable movement. The old electroshock therapy room seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy.

## The Scream

At precisely 3:17 AM, a bloodcurdling scream echoed through the halls. My recording equipment captured a voice—not human, not quite animal—begging to be released from some unseen torment.

### The Final Discovery

In the basement, hidden behind a rusted metal door, we found patient files detailing horrific psychological experiments. The true horror wasn't just what happened here—but what might still be waiting in the shadows.

**Warning: Some stories are better left untold.**
