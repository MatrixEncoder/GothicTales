# The Forgotten Trail

The Shadowpine Forest had always been more than just trees and undergrowth. Locals spoke in hushed tones about travelers who entered and never returned, about sounds that weren't quite natural.

## The Expedition

Our research team was tracking unusual electromagnetic anomalies. What we found was beyond scientific explanation.

### First Signs

The forest seemed to breathe. Branches moved without wind. Shadows danced at the edge of our vision. Our GPS devices went haywire, showing impossible paths and locations.

## The Encounter

As night fell, the whispers began. Not wind through leaves, but actual voicesâ€”speaking in a language older than human civilization. Ancient. Hungry.

### The Transformation

By midnight, two of our team members had vanished. Their equipment remained, but they were simply... gone. No trace, no struggle. Just absence.

The forest remembers. And it was watching us.
