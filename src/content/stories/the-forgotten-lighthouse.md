# Beacon of Darkness

The Ravenrock Lighthouse stood as a sentinel against the merciless Atlantic, its history etched in salt and shadow.

## The Last Keeper

James Holloway arrived for his six-month rotation on September 3rd, 2023. By December, he was the only one who remained.

### First Signs of Strangeness

- Communication systems failed mysteriously
- Radio transmissions carried whispers in unknown languages
- Shadows moved against the wind
- Temperature would drop suddenly, freezing equipment

## The Transformation

As weeks passed, James's logs became increasingly fragmented. Descriptions of entities that weren't human. Sounds from depths that shouldn't exist.

### Final Entry

"They're not trying to get in. They're already here. And I'm becoming something else."

**Some beacons are meant to keep things out. Others, to keep something in.**
