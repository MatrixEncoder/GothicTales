  In the dead of night, when the moon hangs low and the world is silent, the Midnight Train emerges from the mist. Its rusted tracks glimmer with an unearthly sheen, and the carriages creak with the weight of forgotten souls.

  Passengers who board this spectral locomotive never return, their whispers echoing through the empty compartments, telling tales of a journey without end.
